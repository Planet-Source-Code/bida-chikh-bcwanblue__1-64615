Downloading some important files and having tired waiting for them, 
watching the screen from time to time for changes and go away doing other things

and Eureka... 

the idea come, How about developping a small application to send me a notification
about those downloaded files or too any changes made on files by BlueTooth

I have a Nokia mobile which has built-in BlueTooth, I'll use it to monitor those changes to a specific folder.
(the built in BlueTooth on the device must be to work)

the controls are grabbed from PSC, I take the occasion here to thank all who I used it's code here.

Have Fun with this application which I want to share it with you all.

- it allow to monitor a folder for changes (Add, Delete, Rename files and more).
    - can monitor the sub folders too.

- it Allow to send those changes to any device with BlueTooth.
    - whenever a change is made or
    - by indicating a laps of times (minutes) to send changes.

- it allow to send some types of files instantly.
  those types can be customized (add, remove, ...), can be enlarged to more file Types.

- Easily change properties of the device to allow sending notifications to many devices.

- Save and restore device and folder informations, set them once.

- Can be minimized to tray icon to operate silently.

- Ability to select the monitored folder by Select folder control.

I think that's not all but have a look on the Code.

------------------------------------------------
Now about the properties and how to know them

- the executable sender, the application used to send files via the Bluetooth

- the device BlueTooth Adress, this can be known by typing *#2820" on the device
  thil should work on all Nokia Mobiles, for the Pocket Pcs and other mobiles

- The Device name: the name used to identify the device.
  (look at the BlueTooth option of the device).

- The Class Name

Anyway all these Informations can be grabbed from the ShortCut used to send files
to your device by your computer, it exist generaly under the SendTo Folder, 
just edit its properties and you have all those informations if you have set a 
file transfert service between your PC and your Device.

last thing you have to set on your device, your PC as Authorized to let the messages
accepted without the annoying question "Accept yes or No".

Have Fun and let me know your suggestions, any suggestion is welcome

 Add a ComboBox listing all ShortCuts to registered BlueTooth Devices in your Pc
 that's to facilitate grabbing of informations about the device.
